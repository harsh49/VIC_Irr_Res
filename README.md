# VIC_Irr_Res

We have simulated water budget and energy budget over Indian subcontinental basins, using three scenarios from the Variable Infiltration Capcity model by including irrigation and reservoir practices in it:

1). No irrigation and reservoir (VIC-NATURAL) 
2). Free irrigation and no reservoir (VIC-FREE)
3). Reservoir and restricted irrigation (VIC-MANAGED)

Here, we have shared results in below folders.

Fig1: Annual Precipitation (P) and Reservoir Locations used in study.
Fig2: Satellite based Annual Evapotranspiration (ET) (MODIS and GLEAM) and Model (VIC-MANAGED) simulated Annual ET.
Fig3: Annual Land Surface Temperature (LST) from MODIS, AATSR and VIC-MANAGED.
Fig4: Mean monthly observed and simulated reservoir storgae.
Fig5: P, ET, Total Runoff (TR) and LST from one grid.
Fig6: Annual ET change between NATURAL and MANAGED scenario.
Fig7: Same as Fig6 but for TR.
Fig8: Same as Fig6 but for LST.
Fig9: Annual ET change between FREE and MANAGED scenario.
Fig10: Annual Latent Heat Flux and Sensible Heat Flux change between NATURAL and MANAGED scenario.
