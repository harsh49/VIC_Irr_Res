# VIC_Irr_Res

We have simulated water budget and energy budget over Indian subcontinental basins, using three scenarios from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model by including irrigation and reservoir practices in it:

1). No irrigation and reservoir (VIC-NATURAL) <br />
2). Free irrigation and no reservoir (VIC-FREE) <br />
3). Reservoir and restricted irrigation (VIC-MANAGED)<br />

Here, we have shared results in below folders.

Fig1: Annual precipitation (P) and reservoir locations used in study. <br />
Fig2: Satellite (MODIS and GLEAM) based annual evapotranspiration (ET) and VIC-MANAGED simulated annual ET. <br />
Fig3: Annual land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS, AATSR and VIC-MANAGED. <br />
Fig4: Mean monthly observed and simulated reservoir storage. <br />
Fig5: P, ET, total runoff (TR) and LST from one grid. <br />
Fig6: Annual ET change between VIC-NATURAL and VIC-MANAGED run. <br />
Fig7: Same as Fig6 but for TR. <br /> 
Fig8: Same as Fig6 but for LST. <br />
Fig9: Annual ET change between VIC-FREE and VIC-MANAGED run. <br />
Fig10: Annual latent heat flux and sensible heat flux change between VIC-NATURAL and VIC-MANAGED run. <br />
